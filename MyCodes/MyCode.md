This project holds a special place in my coding journey as it marks one of my initial endeavors during my time with Developers Institute. Created using the expressive power of JavaScript and the React framework, the Animated Movie Recommender Chat Bot, fondly known as Archie, is more than just code – it's a delightful exploration into interactive programming.

As a newcomer to the world of development, this project allowed me to grasp fundamental concepts while experimenting with real-world applications. Through the process of creating Archie, I delved into JavaScript and React, gaining insights into the dynamics of state management and user interaction within a chat bot environment.

### Features

Archie is not your ordinary chat bot; it's your virtual movie buddy! The bot kicks off the conversation by asking for your name, making the interaction personalized from the start. But that's just the beginning – Archie guides users through a series of questions to understand their movie preferences and then cleverly suggests the perfect animated movie.

- **Dynamic Conversations:** Archie dynamically adjusts its conversation flow based on user responses.
- **A Touch of Humor:** Expect a dash of humor in Archie's responses, making the movie selection process entertaining.
- **Random Recommendations:** For the adventurous souls, Archie can surprise you with a random movie suggestion upon request.

### Learning Experience

Through the creation of Archie, I honed my skills in **JavaScript**, **React**, and the art of crafting engaging user experiences. This project reflects my growth as a developer, capturing the essence of early learning, experimentation, and the joy of creating something interactive.

Welcome to My Grade Calculator, a pivotal project in my coding journey during my time with Developers Institute. This personalised endeavor allowed me to explore the intricacies of building a grade calculator from scratch, showcasing my growing expertise in JavaScript, React, API integration, and Docker.

### Key Features

1. **User-Friendly Design**

- Crafted wireframes and designed the app interface, ensuring an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
- React components like Header and GradesPage contribute to a clean and structured frontend.

2. **Dynamic Grade Scale**

- Utilized an OpenAPI specification to define a robust API structure for retrieving the latest grade scale data.
- The getGradeScale function in the backend ensures accurate and up-to-date information for users.

3. **Technological Toolbox**

- Built the core of the application with JavaScript and React, blending functionality with a polished look.
- Employed a PostgreSQL database managed through the `db.js` module, enhancing the backend capabilities.
- Dockerized the application, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency across different environments.

### Learning Journey:

In the process of creating My Grade Calculator, I embarked on a multifaceted learning journey. From infusing a personal touch into the design, where wireframes were meticulously crafted, and the fusion of functionality and aesthetics was explored, to mastering React by developing interactive user interfaces, each step brought hands-on experience. Delving into API integration, I defined an OpenAPI specification and implemented the `getGradeScale` function, demonstrating proficiency in API design. Managing a PostgreSQL database provided insights into backend data intricacies, while Dockerisation streamlined deployment for consistent and reliable application scaling. Amidst these technical pursuits, I honed problem-solving skills, tackling challenges to ensure a seamless user experience, and making design decisions that overcame obstacles in the development process. This journey symbolises not just coding milestones but a comprehensive growth in skill, adaptability, and creativity.
